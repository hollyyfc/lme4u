\title{Assumption Checks for Residuals}
\usage{
res_norm(model)

res_fit(model)

res_box(model, group_var)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object from \code{\link[lme4:lmer]{lme4::lmer()}}. Currently not
supporting formula that contains shorthand \code{.}, such as \code{y ~ .}.}

\item{group_var}{A character value specifying the name of the grouping variable.
Must be a valid random intercept in \code{model} and a valid variable in the data used.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
\code{res_norm()}, \code{res_fit()}, and \code{res_box()} provide diagnostic plots to check
model assumptions at the within-group level for linear mixed-effects models
fitted with \code{lme4::lmer()}. These checks are applicable to all valid \code{lmer}
model structures (no shorthand syntax), including complex nested and crossed
random structure.
}
\section{Checking Assumptions}{

\itemize{
\item \code{res_norm()} generates a quantile-quantile (QQ) plot of the Pearson residuals
to assess normality within groups.
\item \code{res_fit()} plots Pearson residuals against fitted values to detect
funnel shapes or mean-variance trends that suggest transformation issues.
\item \code{res_box()} creates a boxplot of residuals grouped by a specified random
intercept grouping variable to visually inspect heteroscedasticity.
}

These plots help detect violations of within-group assumptions in mixed-effect
models (normality, homoscedasticity, independence), which are central to
valid inference in hierarchical models. Between-group assumption checks are
not included here, due to the various natures of complex random structures.
