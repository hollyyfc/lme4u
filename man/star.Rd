\description{
A cleaned subset of the Project STAR dataset. This processed version focuses
on third-grade test scores (math and reading) and includes key variables
for mixed-effect modeling.

\details{
Project STAR is a large-scale experiment in Tennessee (1980s) studying the
effect of class size on student test performance. The original dataset tracked
over 7,000 students across 79 schools from kindergarten to third grade,
in which they were randomly assigned into one of three interventions:
small class (13 to 17 students per teacher), regular class (22 to 25 students
per teacher), and regular-with-aide class (22 to 25 students with a full-time
teacher's aide). The test score data analyzed in this chapter are the sum of
the scores on the math and reading portion of the Stanford Achievement Test.

This processed version focuses on student performance in third grade, ensuring a
hierarchical structure where students are nested within schools. It includes a
subset of key variables related to student demographics, prior-year (2nd grade)
and current-year (3rd grade) test scores, class assignment, teacher qualifications,
and school-level identifiers. All students in this dataset have been controlled as
attending the same school in both 2nd and 3rd grades. This dataset is structured to
facilitate mixed-effects modeling, making it well-suited for evaluating school effects
and treatment impacts.
