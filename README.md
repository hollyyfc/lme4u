## Overview

lme4u is an interpretation and diagnostic tool for linear mixed-effects
models fitted with
[lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html) package.
It aims to provide:

- **Interpretive functions** that translate `lmer()` output into
  user-friendly explanations.
- **Diagnostic tools** for checking model assumptions and visualizing
  hierarchical structures.
- **Hypothesis testing utilities** to facilitate model comparison and
  statistical inference.
- **Support for nested and complex structures**, helping users
  understand random effects.

## Installation

You can install the development version of lme4u from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("hollyyfc/lme4u")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(lme4u)
## Example to be added soon ...
```

## Features in Progress

- [x] Interpretation functions for `lmer()` outputs
- [x] A curated dataset specifically for mixed-effects modeling
- [ ] Model diagnostics and assumption checks
- [ ] Hypothesis testing utilities
- [ ] Vignettes with real-world examples
