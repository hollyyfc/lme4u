## Overview

lme4u is an interpretation and diagnostic tool for linear mixed-effects models fitted with [lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html) package. It aims to provide:

- **Interpretive functions** that translate `lmer()` output into user-friendly explanations.
- **Diagnostic tools** for checking model assumptions and visualizing hierarchical structures.
- **Hypothesis testing utilities** to facilitate model comparison and statistical inference.
- **Curated data** for the purpose of exploring mixed-effect models. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of lme4u from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hollyyfc/lme4u")

# Alternatively:
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("hollyyfc/lme4u")
```

## Example

lme4u is built to assist with lme4 modeling, so make sure both packages are properly loaded:

```{r example-load, message=FALSE}
library(lme4u)
library(lme4)
```

### To Interpret 

This core interpretation function provides user-friendly explanation of a fitted lmer model's fixed and random effects:

```{r example1, message=FALSE}
model <- lme4::lmer(math ~ cltype + math_old + (cltype | school_id), data = star)

explain_lmer(model, details = "general")
```

### To Test Hypothesis

Conduct likelihood ratio test (LRT) on a selected fixed or random effect in a fitted lmer model:

```{r example2, message=FALSE}
fix_result <- lrt_lmer(model, target = "math_old", type = "fixed", data = star)

fix_result
```

### To Check Assumptions

Gain insights on within-group heterogeneity with core residual plots:

```{r example3, message=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.alt = "A suite of residuals diagnostics plots showing within-group assumptions are met for the example model."}
library(ggplot2)

res_norm(model)
res_fit(model)
res_box(model, group_var = "school_id")
```

### To Explore

Utilize this fresh dataset curated specifically for mixed-effect modeling:

```{r example4, message=FALSE}
tibble::glimpse(star)
```
