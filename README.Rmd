## Overview

lme4u is an interpretation and diagnostic tool for linear mixed-effects models fitted with [lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html) package. It aims to provide:

- **Interpretive functions** that translate `lmer()` output into user-friendly explanations.
- **Diagnostic tools** for checking model assumptions and visualizing hierarchical structures.
- **Hypothesis testing utilities** to facilitate model comparison and statistical inference.
- **Support for nested and complex structures**, helping users understand random effects.

## Installation

You can install the development version of lme4u from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("hollyyfc/lme4u")
```

## Example

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(lme4u)
## Example to be added soon ...
```

## Features in Progress

- [x] Interpretation functions for `lmer()` outputs
- [x] A curated dataset specifically for mixed-effects modeling
- [ ] Model diagnostics and assumption checks
- [ ] Hypothesis testing utilities
- [ ] Vignettes with real-world examples
