## Overview

lme4u is an interpretation and diagnostic tool for linear mixed-effects models fitted with [lme4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html) package. It aims to provide:

- **Interpretive functions** that translate `lmer()` output into user-friendly explanations.
- **Diagnostic tools** for checking model assumptions and visualizing hierarchical structures.
- **Hypothesis testing utilities** to facilitate model comparison and statistical inference.
- **Support for nested and complex structures**, helping users understand random effects.

## Installation

You can install the development version of lme4u from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hollyyfc/lme4u")
```

## Example

```{r example, message=FALSE}
library(lme4u)
library(lme4)

# Access built-in dataset
tibble::glimpse(star)

# Construct a linear mixed-effect model with star
model <- lmer(math ~ cltype + math_old + (cltype | school_id), data = star)

# General interpretation of model structure
explain_lmer(model)

# Hypothesis testing of effects
fix_result <- lrt_lmer(model, target = "math_old", type = "fixed", data = star)

# Peek returned test statistics
fix_result

# More to be added ...
```
